# logic-gates
This script comes with logic gates and a Binary Number class that can add and subtract. The main focus of this is the logic gates so there are some limitations to the adding and subtracting

# How to use 
You can take a look at the Binary number class to see how to use things like the adder and subtracter that are both made with the provided logic gates. The adders and subtractors do not support negative numbers or decimals so if you were to do say 101 (5) - 1010(20) it would not return negative 15. I did include a twos compliment function that will work with negative numbers but its not used by anything

# Main Purpose
The main purpose of this is to show how these logic gates can be used to do things while working with binary numbers
