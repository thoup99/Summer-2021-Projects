# How to use
This new version of tictactoe features a few new things that will be listed below. To play the game make sure to run the TicTacToe.py file. If you wish to edit what kind of player
you are going up against then you can change the name of the players on line 5 of TicTacToe. You can also build a player that functions the way you want it to in the Player.py
file. Just be sure to import it into the main tictactoe file.

# Changes
-Split the game into three files containing the players, game, game runner.  
-Added a SmartishPlayer that can give you somewhat of a challenge.  
-Added an example player that shows how easy making one for yourself is.
